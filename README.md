# machine-learning-learnings

This repository contains all my learning for software-engineering and Machine Learning

<!-- 1. Mathematics Foundations
Linear Algebra

Calculus (focus on partial derivatives, gradients)

Probability and Statistics

2. Programming Fundamentals
Python (recommended language for ML/AI)

Data Structures and Algorithms (essential for efficient coding, not just in interviews)

3. Data Manipulation & Analysis
Numpy (numerical computing)

Pandas (data handling and manipulation)

4. Data Visualization
Matplotlib, Seaborn (basic to advanced visualizations)

Plotly (interactive visualizations)

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tableau (Business Intelligence tools, optional but useful)

Pandas visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib (for code-based EDA)

6. Machine Learning Libraries
Scikit-Learn (essential for classical ML models)

TensorFlow or PyTorch (deep learning frameworks, for advanced/deep learning topics)

7. Model Evaluation & Improvement
Cross-validation, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, etc.), hyperparameter tuning

8. Introduction to Advanced Concepts
LLMS (Large Language Models), GenAI (Generative AI)

Basics of how LLMS work

Use of APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)

Prompt engineering

9. Projects & Practical Applications
End-to-end ML/AI projects (data collection to deployment)

Mini-projects focusing on different areas: EDA, prediction, classification, NLP, computer vision, etc.

Optional but Helpful Additions
SQL (for working with databases)

Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure – for scaling and deployment)

Version control (Git)
